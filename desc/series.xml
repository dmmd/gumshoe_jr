            	<desc>10.61 MB (992 files). This series consists of 992 WordPerfect files on 51 5.25-inch floppy disks. Files are arranged by year according to last modified dates as recorded in the original file system metadata. Files with no modification dates are listed as undated.

				File content includes Dickstein’s curriculum vitae (1994-1997); outgoing correspondence, such as conference planning materials (1986-2000); and professional files, primarily course materials (course descriptions, syllabi, and assignments) and drafts of book chapters, articles, essays, and reviews (1981-1999). Although some of these documents mirror items in the paper records, many, especially Dickstein’s letters and essay drafts, are not found elsewhere in the collection.</desc>
