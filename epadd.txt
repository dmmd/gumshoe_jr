Transfer: 

What is the yield of a transfer -- information in a database or is there an actual document of recored, e.g. a new MBox file. I'd like be able to document and preserve the transfer is the information serialized anywhere. 

loading the email into the appraisal module does not constitute 'transfer' if data is being loaded into a system, then what is this action.
